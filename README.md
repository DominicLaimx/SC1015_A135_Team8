# SC1015_A135_Team8

## About
This is our mini-project for SC1015 (Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) where we explore a dataset on AirBnB prices in European cities. Do take a look at our jupyter notebook code.

## Dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities

## Problem definition
What variables are important in predicting AirBnB prices?

Which transformation is best for skewed data?

## Conclusion 
City was the most important variable in predicting AirBnB prices

Several variables did not help much in predicting AirBnB prices

Boxcox, log and square root transformation all improved our linear regression model

Boxcox and log transformation improved our linear regression model the most

## What did we learn from this project?
Handling imbalanced highly skewed data set

Working with mixed data 

Analysing of different variables in real-world context

Using different transformation techniques to improve linear regression

Evaluating different models based on various metrics
